# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Clssification-using-Deep-Learning.


**About the MNIST dataset:**


---> It consists of 60,000 images with 28X28 dimension and 10,000 test image data. 
It is a type of grascale images and the image processing and cross vlidation part is already done in this dataset.  



We can find the dataset directly in the keras library where can used the api .https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/



**Operations carried out:**


1. Importing the necessary depencies(library).
2. Load the dataset in the google colab directory.
3. Image data analysis.
4. Image label analysis.
5. Building the neral network using tensorflow and keras library.
6. Model Evaluation to check accuracy and loss on test data and also if there is any overfitting pr not.
7. Use Confusin matrix and visualize the data using heatmap
8. Build a predictive system, which will take different handwritten digit images as a path and can recognize the label of the image data.
